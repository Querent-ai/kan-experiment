This is the official repository for our paper [KAGNN: Evaluating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks on Graph Learning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18380).

All experiments were run with python>=3.11.

The code is split by learning task (among node classification, graph classification, graph regression). Scripts are provided so experiments can be reproduced.
